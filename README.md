# Need for speed: JVM tooling overview

Slide deck of presentation "**Need for speed: JVM tooling overview**" given at **Latcraft | Java** (Riga), *2015* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

> Monitoring your production JVMs is extremely important. Though, not always you have a luxury of having direct access to production servers, which suffer from performance peaks, memory leaks or concurrency issues. Not always you are able to catch JVM issues without an ability to debug the code in-place. There are quite many tools that can help analyzing performance issues of your JVMs based on real-time monitoring data as well as on logs available only post-mortem. This presentation will give an overview of these tools.
